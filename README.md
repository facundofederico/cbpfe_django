# CBPFE

CBPFE (Clustering Based Pareto Front Exploration) is an intuitive tool for the exploration of a Pareto Front.

## Description

This is a refactor of an old project (https://github.com/facundofederico/ClusteringBasedParetoFrontExploration), using Django.

A **Pareto Front** is the set of **quasi-solutions** that result from the optimization of a problem with multiple objectives. These solutions are all optimal (in a mathematical sense), but they all have different characteristics.

The objective of this tool is to ease the selection process by letting the user discard entire subsets based on their personal prefferences. This is archieved by relating each solution to a group of **requeriments** and **stakeholders** it satisfies, clustering the solution population and showing the user each cluster's metadata (showing, for example, what requeriments are more present in that subset).
